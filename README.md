# Forecasting: Principles and Practice — The Pythonic Way

This repository contains my personal study of the online textbook  
**_Forecasting: Principles and Practice The Pythonic Way_**

It includes exercises, and experiments implemented in **Python** using **Jupyter Notebooks**, following the structure and concepts of the book.
The goal is to better understand time series analysis and forecasting methods through hands-on practice.
